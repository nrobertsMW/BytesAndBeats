# Bytes and Beats

**Curriculum Module**  
_Created with R2024a. Compatible with R2024a and later releases._ 

## Description ##
With Bytes and Beats, students will use MATLAB&reg;, the programming platform  used by scientists and engineers, to turn if-statements, for-loops, and functions into rhythms, melodies, and harmonies. Working with friends, they will compose and visualize their own music and invent their own symphonic creations. 

This material contains interactive MATLAB [Live Scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html) to assist instructors in teaching computer programming and musical concepts. They can be leveraged as demonstrations, activities, or interactive assignments. 

## How to Use this Content ##
Modules are numbered to show a recommended flow, but do not necessarily need to be completed sequentially. You may choose to complete whichever modules fit the experience level of your students. 
This means that modules can be leveraged as:
- Individual lessons/activities
- A combination of modules, either in order or mixed and matched    
- A week-long course, consisting of a few modules per day:

| Day 1                     | Day 2                                | Day 3                                      | Day 4                               |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|

| 2. What is Programming?   | 6. Practice with Indexing            | 10. Tunable Parameters and “If” Statements | 14. Working with Sound Files        |
| 3. Introduction to MATLAB | 7. Vectors, Variables, and Functions | 11. Figures and Callback Functions         | 15. Creating a Melody               |
| 4. Using Variables        | 8. Using Functions to Create Music   | 12. Creating a Virtual Theremin            | 16. Music Mixer App and Performance |

## Prerequisite Domain Knowledge ##
There are no prerequisites for these modules, but instructors and students can use [MATLAB Onramp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/matlab-onramp/gettingstarted) or [Learn to Code](https://learntocode.mathworks.com/) (for younger students) as a resource to become familiar with Live Scripts and MATLAB syntax.

Students will need laptops  or Chromebooks with access to the Internet to use MATLAB&reg; Online&trade;. MATLAB Online provides access to MATLAB and Simulink through a web browser, eliminating the need to install the entire application on a device.
For the best overall experience, Google Chrome&reg; is recommended to access MATLAB Online.

## Classroom Requirements ##
It is recommended to set up desks and tables such that students can move around to facilitate group work and can also see the screen where you project the MATLAB lesson plans. Students need laptops with access to power outlets. Internet access is required in order to use MATLAB&reg; Online&trade;

## Curriculum Components ##

**Instructor Guides**

Each module has its own Instructor Guide in the form of a Live Script or Word document. These contain all the background information, course preparation, and lesson plans for the activities to cover with the students. Be sure to read them carefully as they contain the basic information you need to teach each module successfully. 
_Tip: To effectively navigate the Instructor Guides, you can make use of the Table of Contents at the top._

**Student Live Scripts**
While you use the Instructor Guides to direct the modules, students will be opening Live Scripts through the File Explorer or via the command line , as shown below:

![Command Window Demo](/uploads/b36f2e649e83023e19b242bc930c1435/image.png)

They will follow along with these and are not given a set of Instructor Guides.

**Student Worksheets and Handouts**

Included are worksheets and handouts that students fill out to reinforce concepts, the modules indicate when to print/distribute each worksheet. Handouts contain a list of vocabulary and common MATLAB commands the students need in the course. Encourage the students to refer to the handouts throughout the course. The 'Materials' section in each activity lists the Worksheets and/or Handouts required for that activity.

## What is a Live Script? ##

Within this content, MATLAB Live Scripts (".MLX") are employed, which are interactive documents that combine MATLAB code with formatted text, equations, and images in a single environment called the Live Editor. Both “.M” files and “.MLX” files will execute the written code the same, but the Live Scripts are meant to be interacted with as an educational or visual tool.

_Note: Modules are also available in Word document format_

## Installing the Bytes and Beats Toolbox and Materials ##

_These instructions are for both instructors and students._

Open a web browser and go to the following web address to access a link to download the curriculum:
https://www.mathworks.com/academia/courseware/bytes-and-beats.html 

Open a web browser and go to the following web address to access MATLAB Online: 
https://matlab.mathworks.com/

Once the curriculum zip file has been downloaded, open the web browser (Google Chrome&reg; or Microsoft Edge&reg;) and go to:
https://drive.matlab.com

You must use your MathWorks&reg; User ID and Password to login and use MATLAB. 
If you need to create an account, you can do so at the following link:
https://www.mathworks.com/mwaccount/account/create?uri=

Upload all the files within the zip folder to MATLAB&reg; Drive&trade;:

![MATLAB Drive Upload](/uploads/b101c05e815c99add556e1bf9bf23398/image.png)

Once this process is completed, go to MATLAB Online from your web browser:
https://matlab.mathworks.com/

![MATLAB Online Preview](/uploads/9eb4ab15c1bf32c8396fb110015aa6bf/image.png)

Within the Command Window, next to the >> symbol, enter the following:
 ```js
 >> setupBnB
``` 
This will start installing the course toolbox and the audio files.
_Note: This could take several minutes to complete. You only need to run ‘setupBnB.m’ once to install the course toolbox and the audio files._

Navigate to the **APPS** tab in MATLAB Online. Once you see all six Apps below, the toolbox has installed successfully:

![Bytes and Beats Apps](/uploads/b10a8041506310c238552226842bc874/BnB_Apps.png)


From there, you can get started by opening the modules within the 'instructor_resources > instructor_guides' folder.
The instructions inside these will guide you through the exercises and activities.

## Educational Standards ##

**NGSS**

_MS-ETS1-2._ Evaluate competing design solutions using a systematic process to determine how well they meet the criteria and constraints of the problem.

_MS-ETS1-3._ Analyze data from tests to determine similarities and differences among several design solutions to identify the best characteristics of each that can be combined into a new solution to better meet the criteria for success.

**ISTE**

_Creativity and Innovation_ 
- Apply existing knowledge to generate innovative ideas, products, or processes.
- Create original works as a means of personal or group expression.

_Critical thinking, problem solving, and decision making_ 
- Identify and define authentic problems and significant questions for investigation.
- Plan and manage activities to develop a solution or complete a project.
- Collect and analyze data to identify solutions and/or make informed decisions.
- Use multiple processes and diverse perspectives to explore alternative solutions.

**CSTA**

_Computational Thinking_
- Use the basic steps in algorithmic problem-solving to design solutions (e.g., problem statement and exploration, examination of sample instances, design, implementing a solution, testing, evaluation).

_Computing Practice & Programming_
- Implement problem solutions using a programming language, including: looping, behavior, conditional statements, logic, expressions, variables, and functions. 
- Demonstrate dispositions amenable to open-ended problem solving and programming (e.g., comfort with complexity, persistence, brainstorming, adaptability, patience, propensity to tinker, creativity, accepting challenge).
